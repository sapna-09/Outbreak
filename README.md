# Outbreak
It is a shooter game in which the player moves a Sanitizer horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at germs overhead. I built it while learing pygame library in Python and to have fun.

# Instructions
There will be always six enemies in front of you and once killed, next will appear at random position.
You can fire only one drop at a time and for next hit you have to wait for drop to either kill one germ or exit the screen.
